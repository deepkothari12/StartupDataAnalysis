## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing details about startup funding rounds. By exploring funding trends over time, popular startup sectors, and significant investors, we aim to shed light on:

* Patterns in funding amounts and startup sectors
* The evolution of funding over the years
* Major investors and funding rounds
* Geographical trends in startup funding
* These insights can assist in understanding market trends and predicting future funding patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on startup funding rounds, including:

* Date: When the funding was announced
* Startup Name: Name of the startup
* Sector: The primary industry or domain of the startup
* Location: City or region where the startup is based
* Investment Type: Type of funding (e.g., Seed, Series A, Series B, etc.)
* Amount: Amount of funding raised
